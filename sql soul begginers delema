hey guys i am vivek as you know sql is soul <" . "> 

lets go with table related quiries in sql ----->

create database xyz;
use xyz;
crate table vivekkali(
  col_1 datatype constrains,

------
);

NOTE THAT ::  when creating the table we have use the database means to select the database which is only can be done by 
use dbname               lol..

then insert the data in the table like 

insert into tablename values(----);
 this is corret format to inserting the data in the table
